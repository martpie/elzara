collaboration Elzara Oiseau x [**ZigZagZurich**](https://zigzagzurich.com/)!


We selected one of the paintings from the [**Sunrise in Sahara**](https://elzara.studio/projects/sahara-series) series for the bedding design.

A few words about the series:
_The Sahara Series was born after my first — and so far only — journey to the Sahara in 2021. Life then felt peaceful and joyful, with the freedom of travel just months before everything changed with the** full-scale invasion of Ukraine**._

_The desert has always fascinated me. As someone who loves the sea, I found in the desert a similar rhythm of waves — but shaped in sand. I will never forget its colors, nor the feeling of that sand: the finest I have ever touched, soft as powder and gentle on the skin._

_One morning, together with a group of travelers, I watched the sun rise over the desert. The vast lines, shifting tones, full spectrum of colors, and infinite space moved me so deeply that when I returned to Kyiv, I spent months in my studio searching for colors and forms to translate that beauty into my artistic language._

_The series reflects the phases of sunrise:_
_— the deep blues holding the last traces of night_
_— the first warm rays touched with rose_
_— the glowing oranges and soft beiges of full daylight_

_Unforgettable impressions, unforgettable memories — forever living in these works._

_This series became especially significant: these paintings (created in September–October 2022) were my last joyful, colorful works before the full-scale invasion. By November 2022, I had already begun the Anxiety Series, sensing the approaching upheaval._

Many know that when I arrived in Zurich, I only had my documents, a few T-shirts, and a large roll of paintings that I managed to evacuate from my studio in central Kyiv. The Sahara paintings were among them. Some have since found their new homes in private collections in Switzerland; others remain in my Zurich studio.


**And now, you can bring a new interpretation of my work into your home — you can literally&#160;_sleep in the desert_&#160;at an absolutely accessible price !**
