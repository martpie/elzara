Eight Ukrainian artists meet. They've been given 40 minutes and 16 square meters to give out their voices. A country at war connects them.

They are on the stage, in exile. Their expression is limited. Their artistic identity is put to the test. Their mother tongue and fatherland carry new weight. "40 Minutes of Exile" is not just a performance; it is a testimony.

The performance is part of the EU project Meeting Point, which is a 2-year residency exchange program co-financed by the EU's Creative Europe Program. The program is made for musicians, performing artists, dancers and visual artists. It aims to strengthen artists through masterclasses, residencies and collaborative performances that address current issues, such as the war in Ukraine, and promote social inclusion.

_The project is co-financed by the European Union, and this performance is part of the event series "Together for EU" and is financed through a grant from the European Commission. Responsibility for the content lies solely with the grant recipient._

The performance is created and developped during the residency in [Nordisk Teaterlaboratorium](https://en.ntl.dk/)  11 Oct-22 Oct.
