UASAZ invites you to a special screening of the film Khaytarma, a significant cinematic work that portrays a little-known yet deeply important chapter in 20th-century European history - the 1944 deportation of the Crimean Tatar people.

Based on the life of Amet-Khan Sultan, a Crimean Tatar and twice-named  Hero of the Soviet Union, Khaytarma tells a story of personal courage and collective memory. Through this film, viewers are offered a window into the experiences of a community that faced forced displacement and the loss of their homeland, yet preserved their cultural identity and traditions across generations.

Remembering such histories allows us to better understand the diverse narratives that shape our shared past and foster empathy across cultures.

Khaytarma is not only a historical account â€” it is a tribute to the human spirit and the enduring importance of memory.

After the screening, we are honored to host an online Q&A session with the film's director, Akhtem Seitablayev, an acclaimed Ukrainian filmmaker and cultural leader of Crimean Tatar descent.

This will be a unique opportunity to delve deeper into the history behind the film, its making, and its contemporary significance.

This event is organized by the Ukrainian Association of Students and Academics in Zurich in collaboration with Elzara Oiseau - Ukrainian artist, Crimean Tatar descent.
