**Sahara Series** was born after my first—and so far only—journey to Sahara in 2021. At that time, life felt calm and full of joy, with the freedom of travel—just months before everything changed with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The desert has always fascinated me. Loving the sea, I found in the desert a similar rhythm of waves, but sculpted in sand. I will never forget its colors, nor the feeling of that sand—the finest in the world, soft as powder, caressing the skin.

One morning, with a group of tourists, I watched the sunrise in the desert. The vast lines, shifting tones, the full spectrum of colors, and the endless space touched me so deeply that, back in Kyiv, I withdrew to my studio for months, searching for colors and forms to translate that beauty into my artistic language.

The series reflects the phases of sunrise: the deep blues still holding traces of night; the first warm rays tinged with rose; and finally, the glowing light of orange and beige.

Unforgettable impressions, unforgettable memories—forever living in these works.

 At the beginning of the full-scale invasion I evacuated all my paintings and brought them in Zurich.
