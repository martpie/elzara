Lost Landscapes. Crimea..

Series of applications and drawings. 2024 Paper, pencil, \~18\*27cm.

A series of Crimean landscapes based on my own photographs, depicting the scenery of my homeland—now without me since 2014. These landscapes are slowly fading from my memory, so I am trying to preserve them.

 In the essence of this project lies Crimea – my native land, a land marked by a turbulent history of loss and fortitude. A narrative that deeply resonates with me and explain some aspects of my individuality. Crimea's past is marred by painful chapters through the centuries. In this project, I portray Crimea's beauty and history through its landscapes. The peninsula, with its rich cultural heritage and stunning vistas, Crimea's story is a tapestry woven with threads of diverse influences. From the legacies of Italian craftsmanship and Greek mythology to the echoes of Turkish traditions, each culture has left its mark on Crimea's heritage. These marks were attentively erased from the history during last 3 centuries, and everything that left and even had a chance to be included in UNESCO heritage (like ruins of Greek city Hersonissos for exp), since 2014 is out of control, occupiers build commercial centers, hotels and attractions on these territories.![](/uploads/Lost%20landscapes.%20Crimea.%20Sudaq.2024.pencil%2Cpaper.20%2B30cm.webp "Lost landscapes.
