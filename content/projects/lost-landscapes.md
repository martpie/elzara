Lost Landscapes. Crimea..

Series of applications and drawings. 2024 Paper, pencil, \~18\*27cm.

A series of Crimean landscapes based on my own photographs, depicting the scenery of my homeland—now without me since 2014. These landscapes are slowly fading from my memory, so I am trying to preserve them.
