_Sürgünlik_ (Exile from Crimean Tatar language) is an installation supposed to consist dozens of sculptural objects of geographical shape of Crimean peninsula transformed in a shape of bird which is searching for a freedom and deliberation from the constant repressions.

Dedicated to a 81th anniversary of the Deportation of Crimean Tatars (18.05.1944) from their native land.

Through this project, my aim is to illuminate the lesser-known facets of Crimea's history, notably my personal story as much as the story of indigenous people of Crimea. To talk about displacement, integration, living in exile, being a refugee who has lost the meaning of the HOME, but still trying to put his roots in the new, foreign environment. To build a new sense of belonging while carrying the weight of inherited memory and trauma.

_Sürgünlik_ is not only a tribute to the past but also a reflection on the present struggles of identity, resilience, and resistance. Each bird-shaped sculpture becomes a metaphor for the Crimean Tatar people's journey — uprooted, yet determined to soar. This installation seeks to foster dialogue about cultural erasure, forced migration, and the enduring hope of return, resonating with displaced communities worldwide.

By embodying both fragility and strength, _Sürgünlik_ invites viewers to engage emotionally and intellectually with the complex layers of exile — not as a distant history, but as a lived, ongoing experience.
