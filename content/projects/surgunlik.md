_Sürgünlik_ (_Exile_ from Crimean Tatar language) is an installation supposed to consist dozens of sculptural objects of geographical shape of Crimean peninsula transformed in a shape of bird wich is searching for a freedom and deliberation from the constants repressions.

Dedicated to a 81th anniversary  of the criminal  Deportation of Crimean Tatars (18.05.1944)  from their native land by Stalin.

Through this project, my aim is to illuminate the lesser-known facets of Crimea's history, notably my personal story as much as the story of indigenous people of Crimea. To talk about displacement, living in exile, being a refugee who has lost the meaning of the HOME, but still trying to put his roots in the new, foreign but safe environment.
