My project  _Duality_  for [Found in Translation](https://www.expotranskultur.org/en/%C3%BCber-uns) in [Helmhaus Zurich](https://helmhaus.org/en/)

An Exhibition on Love, Vulnerability and Death

[“Now that heaven and earth and wind are still”](https://helmhaus.org/en/exhibitions/nun-da-himmel-und-erde-und-winde-ruhen)… It sounds so poetic, so dreamy, so romantic, the very antithesis of the troubled times in which we now live. The title of the exhibition dates from the Renaissance and is a quote from a sonnet by the fourteenth-century Italian poet Francesco Petrarca. The composer Claudio Monteverdi set the poem to music during the Baroque period, in 1638, and even then, the place where heaven and earth and wind are momentarily still was riven with unrest, violence and war.

Is the view inwards the only one that can bring us peace – then, as now? Should we be trying more often to reconnect with ourselves? If only to be able to process all the disturbing information with which we are constantly bombarded? Should we be devoting ourselves more to nature and to love? And regarding our own vulnerability as a strength rather than a weakness?

Poetry and music in an art show: This new exhibition at the Helmhaus builds on two “old” works by Petrarch and Monteverdi. The feeling works of contemporary art were selected with a view to finding out more about that feeling of calm in the eye of a storm, a that is obviously not new. The works of art capture whole lives in images, transform biographies into art. They show how the experience and memory of weakness can give rise to a sense of strength and resilience for the future. In these troubled times of ours, they gift us a few precious moments of peace, of reflection, of introspection.
