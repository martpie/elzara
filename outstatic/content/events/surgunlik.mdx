*Sürgünlik* (*Exile* from Crimean Tatar language) is an installation supposed to consist dozens of sculptural objects of geographical shape of Crimean peninsula transformed in a shape of bird. In the essence of this project lies Crimea – my native land, a land marked by a turbulent history of loss and fortitude. A narrative that deeply resonates with me and explain some aspects of my individuality. Crimea's past is marred by painful chapters through the centuries. In this project, I portray Crimea's beauty and history through its landscapes and iconic shape. The peninsula, with its rich cultural heritage and stunning vistas, Crimea's story is a tapestry woven with threads of diverse influences. From the legacies of Italian craftsmanship and Greek mythology to the echoes of Turkish traditions, each culture has left its mark on Crimea's heritage. These marks were attentively erased from the history during last 3 centuries, and everything that left and even had a chance to be included in UNESCO heritage (like ruins of Greek city Hersonissos for exp), since 2014 is out of control, occupiers build commercial centers, hotels and attractions on these territories. Through this project, my aim is to illuminate the lesser-known facets of Crimea's history, notably my personal story as much as the story of indigenous people of Crimea. To talk about displacement, living in exile, being a refugee who has lost the meaning of the HOME, but still trying to put his roots in the new, foreign but safe environment.
