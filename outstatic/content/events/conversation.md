Site-specific installation for [Waschraum 2024](https://wasch-raum.ch/elzara-oiseau/)

Zurich

Conversation, 2024

The project was created for the second exhibition "Resonanzkörper Sound und Skulptur im Raum," in a very unique space, Waschraum (the Bathroom), which is located in a building owned by the Swiss railway company SBB but is also protected by the city of Zurich as a historical heritage site. The space consists of a vast hall with bathrooms and shower stalls entirely covered in tiles, giving it a remarkable fragility and intriguing sound resonance.

Selected artists were tasked with creating works that would integrate into the space and highlight its specificity, complexity, history, and charm.

"Conversation" is a deep exploration of the synesthesia between music and visual art. Inspired by Nik Bärtsch’s intricate rhythms and dynamic energy, I transform sound into visual forms. My unique artistic language shapes these musical elements into captivating visual expressions, inviting the audience to engage in an intimate dialogue between the echoes of sound and the fluidity of lines.

I created a large site-specific, non-transportable installation in a separate darkened room covering 20 square meters. The installation was arranged around the entire perimeter, but especially closer to the ceiling, to create the effect of the lines hanging in the air, conveying the lightness and weightlessness of the melody. Visitors were invited to enter the complete darkness that I established in the room. At the entrance, torches were provided, allowing the visitors to personally discover elements of the installation accompanied by Nik Bärtsch's music, and to set the movement of shadows to their own rhythm.
