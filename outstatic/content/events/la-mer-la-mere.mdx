A sculptural wire installation *La Mer* (2024) created specially for the exhibition Planting Roots by Bahay Contemporary, exploring the wordplay in French between la mer (the sea) and la mère (the mother), which sound exactly the same and have very similar writing. These words hold deep personal significance, as the sea symbolizes my parents' home, family, and the years spent in my homeland - Crimea, which I hope to regain, lost due to occupation in 2014 and fullscale invasion in 2022. Previously explored the theme Homeland, Mother, through different mediums and languages, now transformed into sculptural forms. The installation, made of wire constructions, will mimic waves of words and the movement of sea water. By playing with light and shadow, I aim to create visual imitations of lines and words that reflect the image of the sea in a poignant and expressive way. Through these works I try to keep a non-verbally connection and caressing the hope to feel the scents of the Black sea, to hear its sound some day at my favorite seacoasts in Crimea.
