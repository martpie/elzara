*Sea of Words* - personal exhibition dedicated to my motherland, Crimea.

I will be presenting works created in Zurich, as well as pieces I brought with me during my evacuation from Kyiv in March 2022. Additionally, I will showcase a few of my latest artworks— sculptural objects from the Sürgünlik project (meaning *Exile* in Crimean Tatar), which I have been working on over the past few months.

**Last visit days: Tuesday 25 and Thursday 27 February 2025**

**Finissage: 28 February 19-21h**
