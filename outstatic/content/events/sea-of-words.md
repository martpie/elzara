*Sea of Words* - personal exhibition dedicated to my motherland, Crimea.

I presented the works created in Zurich, as well as pieces I brought with me during my evacuation from Kyiv in March 2022. Additionally, showcase a few of my latest artworks— sculptural objects from the *Sürgünlik* project (meaning *Exile* in Crimean Tatar)
